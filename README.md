🔭 We are currently working on our Project **Face Recognition Attendance System.**

👯 **Face Recognition is a computer application that is capable of detecting, tracking, identifying or verifying human faces from an image captured using a digital camera. Our Aim is practically implemented in real-life environment as an automatic attendance management system.**

🤝 **Use of face recognition for the purpose of attendance marking is the smart way of attendance management system. <p>Face recognition is more accurate and faster technique among other techniques and reduces chance of proxy attendance.</p><p> Face recognition involves two steps, first step involves the detection of faces and second step consist of identification of those detected face images with the existing database.**<p>
